    "tier": "medium",
    "reason": "The image shows a large red building with a clock tower and a flag, which is consistent with some elements of the Courthouse or Civic Building bucket (symmetrical facade, for example). However, it does not exhibit a domed roof or grand staircase, and the stone construction is not explicitly stated in the image title or description. Therefore, the semantic confidence score is medium."

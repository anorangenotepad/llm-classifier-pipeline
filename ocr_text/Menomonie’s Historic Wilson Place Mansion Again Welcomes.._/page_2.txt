A 1999 Dunn County News article noted “Wilson Place is a journey through generations. ... Dating back to the
Civil War era, this structure is filled with history. ... Wilson Place and its contents preserve a unique local and

state heritage.”

The Wilson Place belonged to three generations of lumber barons: The Wilsons, the Stouts, and the LaPointes. It
was eventually purchased by the current owners, the Dotseth family. Melissa Kneeland, executive director of
the Dunn County Historical Society, said William Wilson was the first mayor of Menomonie and his family

him.

Wilson Place was originally built on 22 acres in 1859. It has been remodeled and expanded since then. “There

were 11 marble fireplaces, stained glass, and gaming rooms,” Kneeland said.

A historic downtown Menomonie mansion that was home to three generations of lumber

barons is once again open to the public.

An agreement between the current owner of the Wilson Place Mansion, Tim Dotseth, and the Mabel Tainter

Center for the Arts means the Wilson Place will be open for tours on select days and times.

The reopening is viewed as a fundraising opportunity for both the Mabel Tainter and Wilson Place. “We want to

raise money to help restore Wilson Place,” Mabel Tainter Executive Director Lucas Chase said.

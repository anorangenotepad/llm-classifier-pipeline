Menomonie’s Historic Wilson Place Mansion Again Welcomes...

the booming lumber industry at the time. James Huff
Stout — the namesake of UW-Stout — was son-in-law
of the previous owner, having married Wilson’s
daughter, Angelina. The couple remodeled the house
together. “There were 22 servants, 17 marble
fireplaces, silk furniture. ... For opulence, there was

even a room lined with leather,” Kneeland said.

By the 1920s, the mansion belonged to the LaPointe
family. George Wilson LaPointe Jr., grandson of
William Wilson, made a living in the lumber industry,
too. The LaPointe family reduced the overall size of
the mansion by two-thirds to better suit their style.
“The mansion changed from federal style to Victorian
style,” Kneeland said. Eventually, it was nearly torn
apart by the LaPointe family to be more modern and
contemporary. Inside, Victorian-style furnishing and

décor inside were preserved.

The Dotseth family bought Wilson Place in 1974 and the building has been privately operated as a museum

since 1976. In recent years, the space has been closed to tours. “They are proud restorationists,” Kneeland said.

Kneeland said the Dotseth family originally sought to turn Wilson Place into a retirement home.

“They saw their mission to preserve that local history,” she said. “All that history would otherwise be scattered

to the wind.”

The Wilson Place now serves as an example of the combination of historical eras. “You can see the

transformation of the generations through the furniture and artifacts. It kind of tells the story,” Kneeland said.

The Mabel Tainter will help the space ease back into tours. “We will do tours about four times a year and in

conjunction with other events,” Chase said.

Upcoming tours at Wilson Place are slated for Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 14-15, and Saturday and Sunday,

Nov. 30 and Dec. 1. Tours will last about 1 hour, and tickets are $25 each. Find tickets by visiting

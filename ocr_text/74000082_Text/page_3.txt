STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE .

In 1889-1890 Harvey Ellis, while working for LeRoy Buffington in Minneapolis|
designed two buildings for the Tainter family of Menomonie, Wisconsin. One
was a memorfal to Mabel Tainter, which serves as a theater and library for
the city. And the other was a residence for Louis Tainter, the brother of
Mabel. (The memorfial is a major architectural monument and an
application for the National Register has been filed.) The Tainter
residence has secondary architectural importance and primary local
historical significance.

Architecturally the building is noteworthy because it is by Harvey Ellis,
an architect who had major influence on midwestern architects in the
nineties. His buildings are fine examples of Richardsonian Romanesque and
this is one of the few residences in that style to be found in central
Wisconsin. Stylistically, it is quite similar to the Mabel Tainter Memorial
and together the buildings are important for the study of Harvey Ellis.

A rock-face rusticated stone exterior on a residence has precedent in H.H.
Richardson's work. Richardson's houses are less picturesque, less
ornamented .and composed of simpler forms.. Ellis and Richardson used many
of the same motifs such as ornamented gables and window groupings. Ellis's
ornament is unique and possibly has roots in Gothic foliate patterns. The
band of ornament on the north side of the building indicates this well with
the alternating spirals and masks. The Tainter residence is a good example
of Ellis's work in the upper Midwest. '

Louis Tainter was the son of Andrew Tainter, a prominent figure in Knapp,
Stout and Co. Louis was born in Menomonie in 1862 and immediately upon
completing his education entered the Knapp, Stout and Company ranks. By
the early eighties he was in charge of logging operations on the Hay River
and then the Red Cedar River. In 1898 he was promoted to secretary of the
company and in 1899 he succeeded his father as vice-president of the firm.
This was a short-lived position because the company closed down in 1901.
Louis Tainter then went on to an illustrious business career in California
and Boston. Upon his death in 1920 he was president and general manager of
a large logging operation in New England. The younger Tainter was considered
one of Menomonie's foremost citizens because of his contributions to Knapp,
Stout, and Company, his membership in a prominent family, and his
distinguished residence.

Project Information:

This project was an early survey began by the Historic American Buildings Survey during the
1930s. The project was never completed. In 2013, HABS made the decision to transmit the
unfinished materials from the 1930s to the Library of Congress due to the information potential
of the documentation, and the fact that many of the unfinished drawings from this period
document important historic properties, many of which are no longer extant. The Head Tide
Church is part of the Head Tide Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of
Historic Places in 1974.

Due to the incomplete nature of the documentation and the lack of field measurements to verify
the drawings, the drawings may not meet HABS standards and have been marked as such. Most
of these drawings are still in pencil, that combined with the age of the drawings, presented
challenges when digitizing them, so the scanned images are not as clear as most of the drawings
within the HABS collection.

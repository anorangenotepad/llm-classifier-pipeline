SUMMARY

Menomonie Omaha Depot

700 4th Street West, Menomonie, Dunn County

Date of Construction: 1906

The railroad depot was an important civic building and in essence was to
the modern city what the city gate was to the ancient cities. The depot
housed the arrival and departure of travelers. Externally the most
conspicuous part of the railroad depot became its silhouette. Late-
nineteenth and early- to mid-twentieth century train passengers became
familiar with the long rectangular buildings, wide sheltering overhangs and
asymmetrical designs of the small town depot. The one-sided depots
enabled passengers to board or disembark a train safely, without having to
cross the train tracks. Such buildings continued in use throughout the
United States for decades without many modifications. Passenger travel
stimulated economic growth by allowing people to be mobile for business
opportunities.

At the turn of the century, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha
Railroad recognized the growing passenger market in Menomonie and
provided the city a more substantial passenger station replacing the small

drafty 1880 station. The 1905 blueprints were designed by nationally

recognized architect Horace P. Padley. During this period in his career he
was an architect in the office of Engineering for the Chicago, St. Paul,
Minneapolis & Omaha Railroad. Whether small or large, each depot
received suggestions from the community. By 1916, more than 85,000
depots and stations had been constructed throughout the United States.

From 1906 to 1961, the Menomonie Omaha Depot served as a hub for
arrivals and departures of daily trains linking Menomonie residents with the
rest of the country. It was the center of modern transportation allowing
Menomonie residents to travel for business, vacation, or to visit friends and
relatives living in other places. Americans enjoyed mobility and would use
rail travel until the 1950s and 1960s when Americans would fall in love with
the automobile. The automobile offered unique, private and independent
travel.

The depot continues to be an area landmark and a symbol of the nineteenth
and twentieth-century railroad industry. Most importantly, it remains as an
excellent example of how the railroad industry and the passenger depot
enhanced the growth of the country and small logging towns such as
Menomonie, Wisconsin.

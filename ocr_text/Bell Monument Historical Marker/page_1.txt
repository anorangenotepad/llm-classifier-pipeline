Bell Monument

Inscription. # When a new building for The Stout

Manual Training School was built in 1897, this bell was

installed in the clock tower to sound the hours of the

day. Large and expensive, this bell was truly an .
investment in, and a symbol of, the promising future of

the school. Founded in 1891, the fledgling institution was

to become the University of Wisconsin-Stout.

In 1914, the bell's striking mechanism became inoperative
and was not repaired. For years students climbed the
stairs of the tower and struck the bell with hammers to
celebrate football victories and other events. As a result
of this treatment, the bell cracked and no longer rang.
The b(?ll rerTlamed in the ‘Fower and was replaced by an Top Trends in Li
electric carillon to mark time for the campus and the T
community. In 1997, the bell was removed and the i
carillon was replaced with five bronze bells - the result of —
several generous donations to the Stout University P

Foundation, Inc.

In 1999, a faculty member and several students designed this monument to display this
historic bell. The bell stands here in its final home, a tribute to the impressive history of this

E %'E institution, but still a symbol of its promising future.

SUMMARY

Menomonie Omaha Depot

700 4th Street West, Menomonie, Dunn County

Date of Construction: 1906

The railroad depot was an important civic building and in essence was to
the modern city what the city gate was to the ancient cities. The depot
housed the arrival and departure of travelers. Externally the most
conspicuous part of the railroad depot became its silhouette. Late-
nineteenth and early- to mid-twentieth century train passengers became
familiar with the long rectangular buildings, wide sheltering overhangs and
asymmetrical designs of the small town depot. The one-sided depots
enabled passengers to board or disembark a train safely, without having to
cross the train tracks. Such buildings continued in use throughout the
United States for decades without many modifications. Passenger travel
stimulated economic growth by allowing people to be mobile for business
opportunities.

At the turn of the century, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha
Railroad recognized the growing passenger market in Menomonie and
provided the city a more substantial passenger station replacing the small

drafty 1880 station. The 1905 blueprints were designed by nationally

recognized architect Horace P. Padley. During this period in his career he
was an architect in the office of Engineering for the Chicago, St. Paul,
Minneapolis & Omaha Railroad. Whether small or large, each depot
received suggestions from the community. By 1916, more than 85,000
depots and stations had been constructed throughout the United States.

From 1906 to 1961, the Menomonie Omaha Depot served as a hub for
arrivals and departures of daily trains linking Menomonie residents with the
rest of the country. It was the center of modern transportation allowing
Menomonie residents to travel for business, vacation, or to visit friends and
relatives living in other places. Americans enjoyed mobility and would use
rail travel until the 1950s and 1960s when Americans would fall in love with
the automobile. The automobile offered unique, private and independent
travel.

The depot continues to be an area landmark and a symbol of the nineteenth
and twentieth-century railroad industry. Most importantly, it remains as an
excellent example of how the railroad industry and the passenger depot
enhanced the growth of the country and small logging towns such as
Menomonie, Wisconsin.

A historic downtown Menomonie mansion that was home to three generations of lumber

barons is once again open to the public.

An agreement between the current owner of the Wilson Place Mansion, Tim Dotseth, and the Mabel Tainter

Center for the Arts means the Wilson Place will be open for tours on select days and times.

The reopening is viewed as a fundraising opportunity for both the Mabel Tainter and Wilson Place. “We want to

raise money to help restore Wilson Place,” Mabel Tainter Executive Director Lucas Chase said.

share that history,” Chase said. He believes the reopening of Wilson Place offers an informative and

transformative experience for locals and visitors.

Wilson Place Mansion overlooks Broadway Street next to UW-Stout’s North Campus. On the outside, it may
just look like a yellow building with vintage-style dark paneling that sits behind a metal gate. But Wilson Place

serves as a true relic of historical Menomonie.

A 1999 Dunn County News article noted “Wilson Place is a journey through generations. ... Dating back to the
Civil War era, this structure is filled with history. ... Wilson Place and its contents preserve a unique local and

state heritage.”

The Wilson Place belonged to three generations of lumber barons: The Wilsons, the Stouts, and the LaPointes. It
was eventually purchased by the current owners, the Dotseth family. Melissa Kneeland, executive director of
the Dunn County Historical Society, said William Wilson was the first mayor of Menomonie and his family
designed the home to look like a federal-style building. Wilson died in 1892, and the building was named after

him.

Wilson Place was originally built on 22 acres in 1859. It has been remodeled and expanded since then. “There

were 11 marble fireplaces, stained glass, and gaming rooms,” Kneeland said.
